# Project: Translator Transformer

## Description:
This project implements a Transformer-based neural machine translator for translating Italian to English. During development, I encountered several debugging challenges, which led me to study a clear and practical implementation from [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/building-transformer-models-with-attention-crash-course-build-a-neural-machine-translator-in-12-days/).After understanding the approach, I adapted it for this project.

## Notes:
This work provided a great opportunity to:
  1. Review the Transformer architecture in depth.
  
  2. Learn how to implement it efficiently for an easier debugging process.
  
  3. Practice data preprocessing for translation tasks.
