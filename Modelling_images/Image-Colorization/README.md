# Project: Colorizing Grayscale Images with Transfer Learning and Autoencoders

## Description:
This project focuses on colorizing grayscale images using a combination of transfer learning and autoencoders. The model leverages knowledge from VGG16 to fine-tune an autoencoder for image colorization in the LAB color space.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedownhill/art-images-drawings-painting-sculpture-engraving)
