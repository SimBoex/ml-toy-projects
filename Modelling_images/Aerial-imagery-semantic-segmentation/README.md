# Project: Aerial imagery semantic segmentation

## Description:
This project tackles a semantic segmentation task in remote sensing images. I used Weights & Biases (wandb) for the first time to track experiments and fine-tune hyperparameters efficiently, applying techniques learned during university to minimize GPU usage.

Some implementation ideas and code were adapted from [DigitalSreeni](https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalSreeni)

## Notes:
- Model performance can be improved by enhancing convergence between training and validation losses:

   2. Apply batch norm to improve the convergence;
   3. Adding a learning rate scheduler to further improve convergence.
   3. Conducting a more in-depth grid search for hyperparameters.
