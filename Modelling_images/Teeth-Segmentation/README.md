# U-Net Teeth Segmentation

## Description:
This project focuses on teeth segmentation in dental X-ray images using a U-Net architecture. The model addresses class imbalance with binary focal loss to improve segmentation performance.

## Dataset:
The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/humansintheloop/teeth-segmentation-on-dental-x-ray-images)

## Notes
- Due to limited computing resources, training was performed on Colab Pro.

- The U-Net implementation and some ideas were adapted from [DigitalSreeni](https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalSreeni) (eg. Unet Implementation)
